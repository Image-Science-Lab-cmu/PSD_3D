# Computational 3D Imaging with Position Sensors
Code and data for "Computational 3D Imaging with Position Sensors" in ICCV 2023.

## Code
We include a physically-accurate two-bounce rendered implemented in MATLAB in `two_bounce/`.
`macro_scan.m` demonstrates how to perform a 3D line scan of an object using with and without global illumination suppression.
`macro_nPatt_v_sc.m` demonstrates how to sweep the number of patterns and pattern scale.

## Data
3D point clouds from our lab prototype are in `point_clouds` as .ply files. They can be viewed in MeshLab.

`-no-suppression` denotes a single raster scan was used.

`-minmax` denotes the min/max processing of Nayar et al. [1] was used for global illumination suppression.

`-ours` denotes our proposed regression method was used for global illumination suppression.

Each point cloud is post-processed with bilateral filtering on the depth map, and points whose total intensity is below a threshold are removed.
